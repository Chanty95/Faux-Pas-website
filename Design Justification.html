	   <p2> User experience can be defined as all aspects of a user's interaction with a product, service or company that influence the user's perception of the whol; and is a discipline concerned with&nbsp; all elements that collectively make up an interface including layout, visual design, brand, text, and interaction (Usability Professionals Association, 2019). The Faux Pas team understands that a website is the first or second moment of interaction with our clients that is why we want it to be an impactful first impression.  Consequently, the Faux Pas  website  visually and functionally represents the brands values of confidence, diversity, creativity and freedom; whilst providing a high user experience.&nbsp; We will now go through how we attempted to achieve this.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p2>

<p><strong>Target Audience</strong>
			<br>
		    Before deciding on the look of the Faux Pas website, we thought about our target audience: millenials. The website should ultimately be parallel to what they are accustomed to seeing on other websites. Considering that they are exposed to different interfaces, we aimed to make a website with a memorable aesthetic but most importanlty one that appeals to our specific target audience with the need for authenticity in a world filled with perfectionism and judgement.&nbsp;</p>
	<p><strong>Theme</strong>
<br>
We choose the theme of confidence because it is one of the pillars of the brand, but is also what we want our clients to become after making use of our services. That is why the images have a lot of XXX confident and content people in them.These people also have a youthful face. Other images may include a more creative side of Faux Pas as well,  because it fits with the brand image we want to get across.</p>
	
<p><strong>Colours &amp; Fonts</strong>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;
			<br> Firtsly, we decided upon a colour palette that would establish a consistency throughout the website. The palette was inspired by our brand logo.<br>
			<img src="images/LOGO.jpg" width="400" height="100" alt="faux pas logo"> 
			<img src="images/Colour palette.png" width="400" height="100" alt=""> &nbsp; &nbsp; 
			<br><br>From left to right the colors HEX code:
				<ul>
			  <li>#171124</li>
			  <li>#352D76</li>
			  <li>#473AAB</li>
			  <li>#661971</li>
			<li>#F8EAFD</li>
				</ul>
			<br>Regarding the text, we wanted to go with a font that was both XX and XX, therefore we opted for the XX font from the Google fonts library.
	</p>

		
	<p><strong>User Interface</strong>
			<br>For the layout we went for a simple scroll down or Z-pattern. Because our brand offers different services with each being very specific, we decided to not overwhelm our clients with to much text from the onset. That is why many pages have brief descriptions or are mostly visual. In contrast the services pages include many reviews and information and are textually more dense but still have a clear overview of the service, service reviews and other options through the use of a clean-cut structure. 
	  Pages with activation points  e.g. the Sign-up page and Payment page slightly diviate from the norm because they need to be GDPR compliant. Nontheless, they still have the Faux Pas touch through the complementary XXimages??.</p>
	
	<p><strong>User Prototype tests</strong>
			<br>During the development phase of our website we conducted usability tests..</p>
